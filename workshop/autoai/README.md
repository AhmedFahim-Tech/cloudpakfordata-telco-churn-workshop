# Automate model building with AutoAI

For this part of the workshop, we'll learn how to use [AutoAI](https://www.ibm.com/support/producthub/icpdata/docs/content/SSQNUZ_current/wsj/analyze-data/autoai-overview.html).
AutoAI is a service that automates machine learning tasks to ease the tasks of data scientists. It automatically prepares your data for modeling, chooses the best algorithm for your problem, and creates pipelines for the trained models.

This section is broken up into the following steps:

1. [Create a Project and AutoAI instance](#1-create-a-project-and-autoai-instance)
2. [Set up your AutoAI environment and generate pipelines](#2-set-up-your-autoai-environment-and-generate-pipelines)
3. [AutoAI pipeline](#3-autoai-pipeline)
4. [Deploy and test the model](#4-deploy-and-test-the-model)

## 1. Create a Project and AutoAI instance

### Create a Watson Studio project

* From the Projects page, click `New Project`:

![Create project](../.gitbook/assets/images/autoai/autoai-create-project.png)

* Select `Create an empty project:

![Create empty project](../.gitbook/assets/images/autoai/autoai-create-empty-project.png)

* Name your project:

![Name your project](../.gitbook/assets/images/autoai/autoai-name-project.png)

The data assets page opens and is where your project assets are stored and organized. By clicking the `Assets` bar, you can load your dataset from the left interface:

* Upload the [Telco-Customer-Churn.csv](dataset/Telco-Customer-Churn.csv) dataset.

![Upload dataset](../.gitbook/assets/images/autoai/autoai-upload-data-set.png)

## 2. Set up your AutoAI environment and generate pipelines

* To start the AutoAI experience, click `Add to Project` from the top and select `AutoAI`.

![Adding a project](../.gitbook/assets/images/autoai/autoai-add-project.png)

* Name your service and choose one of the compute configuration options listed with a drop-down menu. Then, click `Create`.

![Naming your services](../.gitbook/assets/images/autoai/autoai-name-services.png)

* Select your dataset (you can upload it from your local or select from project).

* To set up your AutoAI instance, check out this video.

## 3. AutoAI pipeline

The experiment begins just after you complete the previous processes. The AutoAI process follows this sequence to build candidate pipelines:

* Data pre-processing
* Automated model selection (Pipeline 1)
* Hyperparameter optimization (Pipeline 2)
* Automated feature engineering (Pipeline 3)
* Hyperparameter optimization (Pipeline 4)

![Credit analysis pipelines](../.gitbook/assets/images/autoai/autoai-setup-instance.png)

The next step is to select the model that gives the best result by looking at the metrics. In this case, Pipeline 4 gave the best result with the metric "Area under the ROC Curve (ROC AUC)." You can view the detailed results by clicking the corresponding pipeline from the leaderboard. an then save your model with `Save as model` button from the top-right side. You are going to simple save the model that gave the best result for us.

![Model evaluation](../.gitbook/assets/images/autoai/autoai-model-evaluation.png)

A window opens that asks for the model name, description (optional), and so on. After completing this fields, click `Save`.

![Save model name](../.gitbook/assets/images/autoai/autoai-save-model-name.png)

You receive a notification to indicate that your model is saved to your project. Click `View in project`:

![Model notification](../.gitbook/assets/images/autoai/autoai-model-notification.png)

## 4. Deploy and test the model

* To prepare the model for deployment, from the Overview tab click `Promote to deployment space`:

![Deploying the model](../.gitbook/assets/images/autoai/autoai-deploy-model.png)

*  To promote an asset, you must associate your project with a deployment space. Click `Associate Deployment Space`:

![Associate Deployment Space](../.gitbook/assets/images/autoai/autoai-associate-deployment-space.png)

* If there is a deployment space you created before you can continue with the Existing tab. Otherwise, go to `New` tab, and give a name for your deployment space, then click `Associate`.

![Create Deployment Space](../.gitbook/assets/images/autoai/autoai-create-deployment-space.png)

* After you promote the model to the deployment space succesfully, a notification will pop-up on the top as below. Click `deployment space` from this notification. Also you can reach this page by using the (â˜°) hamburger menu and click `Analyze` -> `Analytics deployments`:

![Deployment Space](../.gitbook/assets/images/autoai/autoai-view-deployment.png)

* Refer to the following video for the next steps.

    ![Video for model deployment](../.gitbook/assets/images/autoai/autoai-deployment.gif)

* Now you can test your model from the interface that is provided after the deployment. You can either provide your input in JSON format or enter the input details to the fields given in the interface.

    * Input with JSON format
    ![Input with JSON format](../.gitbook/assets/images/autoai/autoai-input-json.png)

    * Input to the fields
    ![Input to the fields](../.gitbook/assets/images/autoai/autoai-input-fields.png)

   ```
   Input data:
   { "input_data":[ { "fields":[ "customerID", "gender", "SeniorCitizen", "Partner", "Dependents", "tenure", "PhoneService", "MultipleLines", "InternetService", "OnlineSecurity", "OnlineBackup", "DeviceProtection", "TechSupport", "StreamingTV", "StreamingMovies", "Contract", "PaperlessBilling", "PaymentMethod", "MonthlyCharges", "TotalCharges" ],
     "values":[ [ "7567-VHVEG", "Female", 0, "No", "No", 0, "No", "No phone service", "DSL", "No", "No", "Yes", "No", "No", "Yes", "Month-to-month", "No", "Bank transfer (automatic)", 85.25, 85.25 ] ] } ] }
   ```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, I explained how to train your model with the AutoAI service on the Cloud Pak for Data platform. Along with this training process, you have learned how to deploy and test the models.
