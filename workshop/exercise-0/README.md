## About the data set

The data set used for this workshop is derived from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). It is originally from Watson Analytics, and looks at customer churn for a Telecommunication company. The data is split into three CSV files and are located in the [data](../../data) directory of this repository.

**[billing.csv](billing.csv)**

This file has the following attributes:

* Customer ID
* Contract *(Month-to-month, one year, two year)*
* Paperless Billing *(Yes, No)*
* Payment Method *(Bank transfer, Credit card, Electronic check, Mailed check)*
* Monthly Charges *($)*
* Total Charges *($)*
* Churn *(Yes, No)*

**[customer-service.csv](customer-service.csv)**

* Customer ID
* Gender *(Male, Female)*
* Senior Citizen *(1, 0)*
* Partner *(Yes, No)*
* Dependents *(Yes, No)*
* Tenure *(1-100)*

**[products.csv](products.csv)**

* Multiple Lines *(Yes, No, No phone service)*
* Internet Service *(DSL, Fiber optic, No)*
* Online Security *(Yes, No, No internet service)*

* Device Protection *(Yes, No, No internet service)*
* Tech Support *(Yes, No, No internet service)*
* Streaming TV *(Yes, No, No internet service)*

## (Optional) Seeding our Db2 database

> **NOTE** If you do not wish to perform this step, your instructor will provide you credentials for a Db2 Warehouse instance.

Log into (or sign up for) [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com).

![](../.gitbook/assets/images/generic/ibm-cloud-sign-up.png)

From the dashboard click on the *Create resource* button to go to the *Catalog*.

![](../.gitbook/assets/images/generic/ibm-cloud-dashboard.png)

Find the [Db2 Warehouse](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/db2-warehouse) tile from the *Database* section.

![](../.gitbook/assets/images/db2/db2-0-catalog.png)

Choose the `Entry` plan as it is compatible with a `Lite` account.

![](../.gitbook/assets/images/db2/db2-0-pricing.png)

Once the Db2 Warehouse service is created click on *Open Console*.

![](../.gitbook/assets/images/db2/db2-1-cloud-launch.png)

You'll be directed to a Db2 web console dashboard where you can load data by clicking the *Load* button.

![](../.gitbook/assets/images/db2/db2-2-console-overview.png)

Select the `billing.csv` file in the [data](../data) folder.

![](../.gitbook/assets/images/db2/db2-3-csv-find.png)

On the next panel we configure where the data will go in the database. We'll use the *DASH100239* schema, and opt to create a new table. Call it `BILLING`, and click *Next*.

![](../.gitbook/assets/images/db2/db2-4-csv-config.png)

On the next panel click *Begin Load* to start loading the data.

![](../.gitbook/assets/images/db2/db2-5-csv-preload.png)

Verify all the rows were loaded.

![](../.gitbook/assets/images/db2/db2-6-csv-loaded.png)

Repeat the process for `products.csv` and `customer-service.csv`, call these tables `PRODUCTS` and `CUSTOMERS`. Note that there will be an additional panel to configure data, the defaults are accetable.

![](../.gitbook/assets/images/db2/db2-8-csv-config-products.png)

Before we go to Cloud Pak for Data, we need to create credentials for our Db2 Warehouse by going back to our service, clicking on the *Service credentials* button, and creating a new credential. Copy these down somewhere as we'll need them in the next section.
