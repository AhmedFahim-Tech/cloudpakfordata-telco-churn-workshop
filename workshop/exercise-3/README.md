# Exercise 3: Build and deploy a machine learning model

## Build a model

### Steps

1. [Download the notebook](#1-download-the-notebook)
1. [Create a new Project](#2-create-a-new-project)
1. [Upload the dataset](#3-upload-the-dataset)
1. [Import notebook to Watson Studio](#4-import-notebook-to-watson-studio)
1. [Import dataset into the notebook](#5-import-dataset-into-the-notebook)

### 3. Download the notebook

*   Either clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/customer-churn-prediction.git
```

or download the notebook directly:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/customer-churn-prediction/master/notebooks/customer-churn-prediction.ipynb
```

### 2. Create a new Project

* From the Main Menu, Choose `Project`

![Choose Project](ChooseProject.png)

* Click `+ New Project`, give it a name of your choosing (preferably using a tag for you to easily identify it from other users), and click `OK`.

* Choose the `From file` tab and navigate to where you downloaded the `customer-churn-prediction.ipynb` notebook, probably in `~/Downloads/`
