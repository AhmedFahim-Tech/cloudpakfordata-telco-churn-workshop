# Cloud Pak for Data Workshop

## Background Info

If you've ever been in an area where there's a natural disaster that's occurred and has affected a large number of people, you may have seen a Facebook notification pop up asking you to report whether or not you are "safe". This has been helpful to families concerned about their loved ones when they can't reach them. Today, we are going to implement this feature with Kitura and WebSockets.

## [Getting Started](./01-GettingStarted.md)

The first chapter of this guide will walk you through the necessary requirements that are needed to complete this workshop, including initial setup for the server, macOS dashboard and iOS client.

## [Server Setup](./02-ServerSetUp.md)

This chapter will be the setup for the server side of the application.  We will be setting up our WebSocket class so that the clients can successfully connect to it in later chapters.

## [Dashboard Setup](./03-DashboardSetUp.md)

This chapter will be the setup for the dashboard of the application.  The dashboard will allow iOS users to connect to it and be visible on the map presented in the dashboard.
